## Education
- Master of Biotechnology, The Pennsylvania State University, University Park, PA (2018 – 2020)
- Master & Bachelor of Technology in Biological Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology Madras, Chennai, India (2012 – 2017)
  - Minor in Nanotechnology

## Research & Work Experience

### Research Investigator, MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX (Jan 2022 – Present)
#### Advisor: Sachet Shukla, Ph.D
- Designing, developing, and validating bespoke pipelines to quantify the expression of human endogenous retroviruses from short reads transcriptomic data
- Discovered correlates of survival and novel antigenic targets by applying the pipeline on in-vitro and clinical lymphoma datasets
- Developing analysis methods for leading 3rd generation long-read sequencing platforms and performing technical validation to benchmark their performance for isoform characterization, structural variation detection and antigen discovery applications
- Writing, analyzing data, and generating figures for grant applications and manuscripts

### Bioinformatics Analyst, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA (Sep 2020 – Jan 2022)
#### Advisors: Toni Choueiri, MD, David A. Braun, MD, PhD
- Elucidated the role of clonal neoantigens and tertiary lymphoid structures as prognostic biomarkers of exceptional response to immune checkpoint blockade therapy in clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC)
- Identified that a mutational signature corresponding to defective repair of DNA damage by homologous recombination was enriched in triple negative breast cancer patients with both poorer overall survival and primary resistance
- Implemented bioinformatics pipelines and statistical tools based on published literature and packaged them as containers to be used for analysis on the cloud
- Analyzed whole exome sequencing and RNA sequencing data of 2000+ patients from clinical cohorts of ccRCC patients treated with immune checkpoint inhibitors and publicly available datasets of cancer like TCGA, PCAWG, etc

### Computational Biologist, Novartis Institute of Biomedical Research, Cambridge, MA (Jun 2019 – Sep 2020)
#### Advisor: Melody Morris, PhD
- Identified transcriptomic signatures of physiological response to cigarette smoke in pre-clinical models of smoking, by analyzing gene expression profiling datasets
- Collaborated with scientists involved in translational research and drug discovery to gain mechanistic insights of the underlying biological mechanisms in the disease models
- Created interactive dashboard to visualize the results from computational analysis
- Assessed the activity of discovered signatures in human disease data to inform expansion opportunities of existing drugs

### Graduate Researcher, Indian Institute of Technology Madras, Chennai, India
#### Advisor: A. Jayakrishnan, Ph.D                                                                           Jul 2016 – Jun 2017
Topic: Block Copolymer Micelles for Amphotericin B Delivery
- Created a shelf stable micellar formulation of Amphotericin B, demonstrated improved aqueous solubility, sustained drug release and lowered toxicity profile

### Summer Intern, Xcode Life, Chennai, India                                                    May 2015 – July 2015
- Reviewed scientific literature to validate genes associated with metabolism and antioxidant activity of micronutrients, for product development and customer information

### Summer Intern, Tata Memorial Hospital, Mumbai, India                               May 2014 – July 2014
- Studied the effect of gamma irradiation on epithelial cells by metabolic labelling followed by protein expression to investigate how Mycobacterium tuberculosis infect epithelial cells
