<p>Hi, I&#39;m Tejas R. Jammihal, a research investigator at MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston, TX. My expertise lies in the field of bioinformatics and computational biology, where I use my technical skills to understand the underlying biological mechanisms of cancer. My goal is to identify novel biomarkers and therapeutic targets that will improve patient outcomes.</p>
<h2 id="education">Education</h2>
<p>I hold a Master of Biotechnology degree from The Pennsylvania State University and a Master &amp; Bachelor of Technology in Biological Engineering degree from the Indian Institute of Technology Madras. I have honed my skills in both theoretical and practical aspects of biotechnology, which have been invaluable in my current role.</p>
<h2 id="research-work-experience">Research &amp; Work Experience</h2>
<p>At MD Anderson Cancer Center, I am designing, developing, and validating bespoke pipelines to quantify the expression of human endogenous retroviruses from transcriptomic data. I have made several exciting discoveries and developed analysis methods for cutting-edge sequencing platforms. Additionally, I have been involved in writing and presenting grants and manuscripts to advance the field.</p>
<p>Previously, I worked as a bioinformatics analyst at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, where I used computational methods to understand the role of clonal neoantigens and tertiary lymphoid structures as prognostic biomarkers in cancer therapy. I also worked as a computational biologist at Novartis Institute of Biomedical Research, where I identified transcriptomic signatures of physiological response to cigarette smoke in pre-clinical models of smoking.</p>
<h2 id="teaching-mentoring-experience">Teaching &amp; Mentoring Experience</h2>
<p>At MD Anderson Cancer Center, I am a peer mentor, where I familiarize new hires with technical and biological know-how in the field of immunogenomics and neoantigen prediction. I also have teaching experience as a teaching assistant at IITM, where I demonstrated and assisted in laboratory experiments and graded lab reports.</p>
<p>If you would like to learn more about me or my work, please feel free to contact me using the contact info below. I would love to hear from you.</p>
